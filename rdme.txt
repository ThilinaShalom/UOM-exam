When I start designing a web page, I will define the purpose and content of the page. This helps me to create a clear and focused design that meets the needs of Assessment 02.

Next, I would create a layout of the page using a design tool(Figma). And I searched for the simple templates on the google. And finally, I'm getting some ideas for how I create my website. then I plan the layout and structure of the page including the placement of elements, the hierarchy of information, and the overall flow.

Once I have a layout in create then, I would choose a color scheme and typography that aligns with the purpose of the page. This helps to create a more visually appealing design.

After the layout and design are in place, I would add styles and interactivity to the page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This might include adding effects, animations, and other interactive elements to enhance the user experience. I am using W3Schools for my reference and this Web Dev course.

Finally, I want to test the page on different devices and browsers to ensure that it is functional and looks good on all platforms. So I would also gather data from when I am testing the Google Chrome developer tools and make any necessary refinements to the design.

This web page includes a header, main content area, and footer. The header has a purple background color and white text, while the main content area and footer have a light blue background color and white text. The font size and padding are adjusted for smaller screens using media queries.

I will upload this code to my GitHub for any contribution to others.
I hope this helps to give you an idea of how I might design a web page. 

thanks.
